# NeuroEvolution
Testing how effective "natural selection" is in producing accurate neural networks 


## To Do 
- [ ] Set up CNN, ViT -> (pytorch + jax for both)
- [ ] Set up 2 datasets -> Google Doodle + real images 
- [ ] Set up normal training pipeline 
- [ ] Train all 4 models 
- [ ] Create function to compare weights (cosine similarity) 
- [ ] Write evolutionary algorithm
- [ ] Test model robustness (add noise)
- [ ] Create dataset with predators, see if model learns to differentiate between different animals 
    - Like if we know ducks don't hurt us but crocodiles + lions will, is there any point to learning the difference between croc/lion
- [ ] Front end maybe? 
- [ ] Animations?
